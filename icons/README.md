# Extension Icons

This directory contains the icons used by the GD Recruit Assistant browser extension.

## Placeholder Icons

The current icons are placeholders that should be replaced with actual icons for a production release. Here's what you need to know:

- **icon16.png**: 16x16 pixels, used for favicons and small UI elements
- **icon48.png**: 48x48 pixels, used for extension management page
- **icon128.png**: 128x128 pixels, used for the Chrome Web Store and installation

## Customizing Icons

To replace these placeholders with custom icons:

1. Create your own icon designs in the required sizes
2. Save them as PNG files with the exact names matching the placeholders
3. Make sure they have transparent backgrounds if needed
