## Recent Key Discoveries

### MultiTeamStorage Data Architecture Fixes Complete ‚úÖ (2025-06-21)
**Major Achievement**: Fixed critical data separation and teamInfo null issues
**Problem Resolved**: Division and world information was showing as "Unknown" or null after team switching

### Clear Team Data Dashboard Refresh Fix ‚úÖ (2025-06-21)
**Issue Resolved**: Dashboard not updating immediately after clearing team data due to missing method error
**Root Cause**: `clearAllData` function was calling `multiTeamStorage.clearAllTeamMetadata()` which didn't exist
**Impact**: Clear operations were failing silently, leaving stale data in dashboard

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Added `clearAllTeamMetadata()` method** to `MultiTeamRecruitStorage` class in lib/multi-team-storage.js
- **Method iterates through all teams** and clears metadata for each team individually
- **Updated background.js clearAllData function** to properly use team metadata clearing instead of incorrect global config operations
- **Enhanced popup.js dashboard refresh logic** with proper timing and cache clearing
- **Comprehensive error handling** with per-team success/failure tracking

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/multi-team-storage.js` - Added missing clearAllTeamMetadata() method
- `background.js` - Fixed clearAllData to use proper metadata clearing
- `popup/popup.js` - Enhanced handleClearCurrentTeam with forced dashboard refresh

**Status**: Clear team data functionality now works correctly with immediate dashboard updates. While not perfect, it resolves several critical issues and provides a solid foundation for further optimization.

This context provides the foundation for continuing development work on the GD Recruit Assistant browser extension, with clear understanding of the current multi-team architecture, implemented features, and development patterns in use. The extension is now feature-complete for v0.3.0 with comprehensive multi-team support and proper data architecture.
