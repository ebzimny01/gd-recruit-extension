### Project Architecture Understanding
From examining the manifest.json and README.md, this project has evolved significantly:

**Migration Context**: The project has migrated from a sidebar-based interface to a full-screen tab interface, representing a major architectural change in v0.2.0.

**Core Features Implemented**:
- Advanced data scraping from Gridiron Dynasty recruiting pages
- Comprehensive filtering and sorting capabilities
- Customizable role ratings and bold attributes
- Import/export functionality with full data preservation
- Full accessibility support (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- Performance optimizations for large datasets (1000+ recruits)

### Current Implementation State
**Extension Structure**: Well-organized Manifest V3 extension with:
- Service worker background processing
- Content scripts for page detection and scraping
- Full-screen popup interface with tabbed navigation
- Modular library architecture
- Comprehensive error handling

**Key Files Currently Open in IDE**:
- `popup/popup.js` - Main application logic
- `content/scraper.js` - Data extraction logic
- `lib/storage.js` - Data persistence layer
- `popup/error-handler.js` - Error management
- `popup/communications.js` - Inter-component messaging

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Interface Migration**: Moved from sidebar to full-screen tab for better UX
2. **Manifest V3**: Adopted modern Chrome extension standards
3. **Local-Only Storage**: Privacy-first approach with no external data transmission
4. **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns across components
5. **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from the ground up

### Performance Considerations
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Implemented for handling large datasets efficiently
- **Debounced Operations**: Reduce unnecessary filter/sort operations
- **Result Caching**: Cache expensive filter results
- **Batch DOM Operations**: Optimize UI rendering performance

### Security Considerations
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only essential browser permissions requested
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS prevention throughout the application
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP implementation
- **Local Data Only**: No external API calls or data transmission

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Coding Standards Identified
1. **Snake_case Variables**: Declared at top of files per .clinerules
2. **CamelCase Parameters**: Function parameters use camelCase
3. **Comprehensive Comments**: JSDoc-style documentation throughout
4. **Error Handling**: Robust try-catch patterns with user-friendly messages
5. **DRY Principles**: Reusable modules and shared utilities

### Browser Extension Best Practices
- **Manifest V3 Compliance**: Modern extension architecture
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Chrome, Edge, Firefox support
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient data handling and UI rendering
- **User Privacy**: Local-only data storage and processing
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Development Workflow
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear component separation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for features
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Testing Focus**: Manual testing across browsers and scenarios
- **Documentation First**: Thorough documentation for maintainability
